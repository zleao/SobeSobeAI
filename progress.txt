## 2026-02-06 - Issue #19: Allow reopen joined games from lobby

- What was implemented
  - Added player userId to lobby game list models so the UI can detect when the current user already joined.
  - Lobby now renders an "Open Game" action for games the user already joined and navigates directly back to /game-room/:id.
  - Join button remains for other games, with the existing full-game disabled state.
- Files changed: frontend/src/app/services/game.ts, frontend/src/app/pages/lobby/lobby.ts, frontend/src/app/pages/lobby/lobby.html
- **Learnings:**
  - The lobby list API already returns player userIds, so the frontend can gate the action without extra API calls.
  - Using the current user id from the auth signal keeps the lobby button state in sync after navigation.

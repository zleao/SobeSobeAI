## 2026-02-02 - Issue #13: Initialize monorepo project structure

### What was implemented
- Created root repository directory structure (frontend/, backend/, infrastructure/, docs/, .github/workflows/)
- Initialized Angular 19+ project in /frontend with Tailwind CSS v3 support
- Initialized .NET 10 solution with multiple projects:
  - SobeSobe.Api (Minimal API)
  - SobeSobe.Core (Domain models and interfaces)
  - SobeSobe.Infrastructure (Data access layer)
  - SobeSobe.AppHost (Aspire orchestration)
  - SobeSobe.Tests (Test project)
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - README.md with project overview and setup instructions
  - LICENSE (MIT)
  - CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
  - docs/game-rules.md (placeholder)
  - docs/api-specification.md (placeholder)
  - docs/architecture.md (placeholder)
- Added comprehensive .gitignore for .NET, Angular, and tooling

### Files changed
- Created: .gitignore, README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md
- Created: frontend/ directory with Angular 19 app, Tailwind CSS v3, PostCSS config
- Created: backend/ directory with .NET 10 solution and 5 projects
- Created: docs/ directory with placeholder documentation files
- Created: infrastructure/, .github/workflows/ directories (empty, ready for next tasks)

### Learnings
- .NET Aspire templates are installed via `dotnet new install Aspire.ProjectTemplates` not workload
- Tailwind CSS v4 requires @tailwindcss/postcss plugin, but Angular build has compatibility issues - using v3 instead
- Angular 19 uses standalone components by default
- Frontend builds successfully, backend builds and tests pass

### Next steps
- Issue #9: Setup .NET Aspire for local development (AppHost is created, needs configuration)
- Issue #12: Write comprehensive game rules documentation
- Issue #11: Define REST API and gRPC contracts

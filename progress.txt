## 2026-02-07 - Issue #22: Fix round start flow

### What was implemented
- Enabled the party player to deal the initial 2 cards during trump selection and enforced blind vs normal timing.
- Auto-dealt initial cards when the party selects a blind trump and advanced to player decisions.
- Dealt remaining cards only when needed during player decisions.
- Added realtime INITIAL_CARDS_DEALT event broadcast.
- Updated the game board UI and service to trigger initial deals and blind trump selection.
- Added integration tests covering blind trump and deal-before-trump flows.
- Ran `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` for the backend.

### Learnings
- Round status stays in TrumpSelection after the initial deal until a trump is chosen.
- Blind trump doubles trick values for all suits.
- Game state only exposes the requesting player's hand, so realtime refresh is needed for card visibility.

## 2026-02-02 - Issue #13: Initialize monorepo project structure

### What was implemented
- Created root repository directory structure (frontend/, backend/, infrastructure/, docs/, .github/workflows/)
- Initialized Angular 19+ project in /frontend with Tailwind CSS v3 support
- Initialized .NET 10 solution with multiple projects:
  - SobeSobe.Api (Minimal API)
  - SobeSobe.Core (Domain models and interfaces)
  - SobeSobe.Infrastructure (Data access layer)
  - SobeSobe.AppHost (Aspire orchestration)
  - SobeSobe.Tests (Test project)
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - README.md with project overview and setup instructions
  - LICENSE (MIT)
  - CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
  - docs/game-rules.md (placeholder)
  - docs/api-specification.md (placeholder)
  - docs/architecture.md (placeholder)
- Added comprehensive .gitignore for .NET, Angular, and tooling

### Files changed
- Created: .gitignore, README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md
- Created: frontend/ directory with Angular 19 app, Tailwind CSS v3, PostCSS config
- Created: backend/ directory with .NET 10 solution and 5 projects
- Created: docs/ directory with placeholder documentation files
- Created: infrastructure/, .github/workflows/ directories (empty, ready for next tasks)

### Learnings
- .NET Aspire templates are installed via `dotnet new install Aspire.ProjectTemplates` not workload
- Tailwind CSS v4 requires @tailwindcss/postcss plugin, but Angular build has compatibility issues - using v3 instead
- Angular 19 uses standalone components by default
- Frontend builds successfully, backend builds and tests pass

### Next steps
- Issue #9: Setup .NET Aspire for local development (AppHost is created, needs configuration)
- Issue #12: Write comprehensive game rules documentation
- Issue #11: Define REST API and gRPC contracts

## 2026-02-02 - Issue #9: Setup .NET Aspire for local development

### What was implemented
- Configured .NET Aspire AppHost to orchestrate the backend API service
- Created SobeSobe.ServiceDefaults project with telemetry, health checks, and service discovery
- Integrated Aspire ServiceDefaults into SobeSobe.Api for automatic health checks and observability
- Added `AddServiceDefaults()` and `MapDefaultEndpoints()` to API for health check endpoints
- Created comprehensive Aspire usage documentation (docs/aspire-usage.md)
- Aspire Dashboard provides real-time monitoring, logs, traces, and metrics
- Used Aspire 9.5.2 with .NET 10 SDK (no workload required, NuGet packages only)

### Files changed
- Modified: backend/SobeSobe.AppHost/AppHost.cs (configured API service orchestration)
- Modified: backend/SobeSobe.AppHost/SobeSobe.AppHost.csproj (added Aspire.Hosting.AppHost package)
- Modified: backend/SobeSobe.Api/SobeSobe.Api.csproj (added ServiceDefaults reference)
- Modified: backend/SobeSobe.Api/Program.cs (integrated Aspire service defaults)
- Created: backend/SobeSobe.ServiceDefaults/ (Aspire service defaults project)
- Modified: backend/SobeSobe.sln (added ServiceDefaults project)
- Created: docs/aspire-usage.md (comprehensive Aspire documentation)

### Learnings
- .NET Aspire 9.5.2 is the latest stable version compatible with .NET 10 SDK
- Aspire 13.x versions don't exist yet; documentation was referencing future versions
- Aspire.Hosting.Sqlite and Aspire.Hosting.NodeJs packages had version compatibility issues
- Removed `IsAspireHost` property to avoid deprecated workload detection in .NET 10
- Simplified AppHost by deferring SQLite integration until database schema is designed (Issue #16)
- Deferred Angular/Node.js integration in AppHost to future iteration
- Used `AddExecutable` as workaround for project reference metadata generation issues
- ServiceDefaults provides automatic health checks at `/health` and `/alive` endpoints
- Aspire Dashboard accessible at https://localhost:17032 or http://localhost:15283
- All builds and tests pass successfully

### Next steps
- Issue #16: Design database schema (will integrate SQLite with Aspire after schema is ready)
- Issue #12: Write comprehensive game rules documentation
- Issue #11: Define REST API and gRPC contracts
- Future: Integrate Angular frontend with AppHost using Aspire.Hosting.NodeJs

## 2026-02-06 - Issue #18
- Ensured the SQLite database is recreated automatically and all EF Core migrations are applied on API startup when the DB file has been deleted.
- Added guarded startup migration logic that runs only for the real SQLite provider (skips integration tests/in-memory DB).
- Files changed: backend/SobeSobe.Api/Program.cs, progress.txt
- **Learnings:**
  - Calling `Database.MigrateAsync()` at startup is the simplest way to both create the database (if missing) and apply pending migrations.
  - Migration-on-start should be skipped for the test/in-memory provider to avoid interfering with integration test database lifecycle.
